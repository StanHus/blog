They both strip away the single most distracting metric in human interaction: **the rating.** They force you to engage with the opponent in front of you, rather than the number or title attached to them.

In online chess, I use "Zen Mode" not to hide chat or board distractions, but specifically to hide the ELO rating. When I can see that number, I immediately stop playing the board and start playing my bias.

If I see an opponent rated 100 points below me, I subconsciously fall back into lazy patterns. I assume there is a reason they are lower-rated, but at my level - hovering around 1900 to 2000 ELO - this assumption is dangerous. There are usually three distinct possibilities for why they are lower rated:

1. They play the same style as me, but are simply worse across the board.
2. They play faster, lower-quality chess.
3. They actually play *better* moves than me, but manage their clock poorly.

If I relax, only the first scenario benefits me. In the second, my laziness leads to time pressure. In the third, I get outplayed because, while I am a strong endgame player, I am nowhere near as well-versed in opening theory as I should be.

> **I dislike playing lower-ranked opponents more than I dislike playing those of the same rank.**

Conversely, when I see an opponent rated *higher* than me, I try to reinvent the wheel. Instead of playing my game, I overthink move-by-move, eventually boxing myself into a corner where the only non-losing options are obscure and fragile.

**When I turn on Zen Mode, I just play.** And invariably, my results are better.

Last week, I experienced this exact phenomenon offline, on a Padel court.

I played with a partner I didn't know. Because I had no context - no "rating" - I was entirely my usual self. I was chatty, aggressive, and combative on the field. I showed my teeth. I actually found him so competent that I asked to switch sides specifically so I could play *against* him. I wanted the friction.

Immediately after the game, I sent a voice note to my wife:

> *"I played with this guy - a perfect teammate, an even better opponent - I hated him! He is a **wolf in sheep's clothing.** He was pretending he didn't care about the game, playing nice, but I could see the hyper-competitive spirit underneath. He pretended not to care, but he wants to win as badly as I do."*

I recognized the pattern because I possess it.

Later, he messaged me. It turns out he is a multi-time CEO of several companies. He saw my LinkedIn handle in my Telegram description (yes I am that weird) and found us to have a lot in common. He invited me to lunch to discuss business and general AI developments.

The realization was clear: **If I had known his "rating" - his status as a prominent CEO - I would not have been myself.**

I would have filtered the aggression. I would have tempered the risk-taking. I would have been less polarizing, attempting to mirror what I thought a CEO wants to see, rather than how I actually operate. I would have tried to "reinvent the wheel" just like I do against a higher-rated chess player.

And in doing so, I likely wouldn't have resonated with him at all. He didn't invite me to lunch because I was polite; he invited me because he saw a fellow wolf in sheep's clothing. He responded to the drive, the "itch" to get things done, and the willingness to compete.

**Thank you, Padel, for providing the logic.**

In life, as in chess, knowing the status of the person across from you rarely helps you play a better game. It usually just convinces you to play a different one - and often, a losing one.
