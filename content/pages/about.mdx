**VP of AI Center of Excellence at Trilogy. AI researcher and prototyper.**

I'm [Stan Huseletov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huseletov/). I build, test, and break AI systems to figure out what actually works in production. My job is to find the limits of what's possible — then push past them.

## What I Do

At **Trilogy's AI Center of Excellence**, I'm the person who writes code to benchmark AI capabilities, builds prototype implementations, and develops automated testing frameworks that separate vendor hype from reality. When a new model drops or a startup claims their AI can do something unprecedented — I'm the one who verifies it.

**My work:**
- **Prototyping** — Building proof-of-concept implementations to understand technical limitations before the company commits resources
- **Benchmarking** — Systematic evaluation of AI tools, models, and capabilities across real-world use cases
- **Applied research** — Translating cutting-edge papers into production-ready systems
- **Tool building** — Creating internal frameworks that let teams move faster with AI

I operate as a one-person R&D lab: scoping, building, testing, and shipping — with no handoffs.

## Currently Building

- **AI agents with strong evaluation loops** — If you can't measure it, you can't trust it
- **Automated testing frameworks** for systematic AI tool evaluation
- **Rapid prototypes** that go from paper to working code in days, not months

## Writing

Most AI content is either too academic or too shallow. I write about what I actually build and learn — grounded in data, shaped by what works in production.
