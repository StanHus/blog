**VP of AI Center of Excellence. Builder of SaaS + GenAI platforms.**

I’m [Stan Huseletov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huseletov/) — I build and launch scalable SaaS, GenAI platforms, and AI agents for governmental and private enterprise clients. My expertise spans cloud microservices, ML systems, and rapid MVP delivery.

**Focus areas:** ML systems, AI agents, cloud microservices, applied research, enterprise delivery.
## What I Do

As **Vice President of an AI Center of Excellence**, I publish weekly **Deep Dives**: in-depth, evidence-backed explorations of critical AI topics — always cited, clear, and actionable for practitioners and decision-makers. I conduct AI research and ML work at [Trilogy AI Center of Excellence](https://trilogyai.substack.com/).

Independently, as an engineer passionate about translating cutting-edge research into real-world impact, I put out **Opinion Pieces**: smart, debate-worthy takes on the state and future of AI — grounded in data, shaped by experience, and always answering: *Why does this matter now?*

## Currently Building

- **AI agents for complex workflows** with strong evaluation loops.
- **ML systems and research** that translate into production impact.
- **Rapid MVPs** that go from idea to production without drama.
