I'm [Stan Huseletov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huseletov/) - I build and launch scalable SaaS, GenAI platforms, and AI agents for governmental and private enterprise clients. My expertise spans cloud microservices, RAG pipelines, and rapid MVP delivery.

## What I Do

As **Vice President of an AI Center of Excellence**, I publish weekly **Deep Dives**: in-depth, evidence-backed explorations of critical AI topics - always cited, clear, and actionable for practitioners and decision-makers. I conduct AI research and ML work at [Trilogy AI Center of Excellence](https://trilogyai.substack.com/).

Independently, as an engineer passionate about translating cutting-edge research into real-world impact, I put out **Opinion Pieces**: smart, debate-worthy takes on the state and future of AI - grounded in data, shaped by experience, and always answering: *Why does this matter now?*

## 3 Questions w/ Stan

Most podcasts are 45 minutes of fluff wrapping 5 minutes of insight. I skip the weather chat and get to the point.
